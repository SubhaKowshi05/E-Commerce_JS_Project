# E-Commerce_JS_Project
This project is a front-end e-commerce checkout system inspired by Amazon. It implements a fully functional shopping cart using Object-Oriented JavaScript, ES6 modules, and LocalStorage for persistence. The checkout page dynamically updates delivery dates, shipping costs, tax, and order totals based on user-selected delivery options.
